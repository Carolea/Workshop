The main difference between the graceful degradation strategy and progressive enhancement is where you start your design. If you start with the lowest common denominator and then add features for more modern browsers for your web pages, you're using progressive enhancement. If you start with the most modern, cutting edge features, and then scale back, you're using graceful degradation. 

A good rule of thumb is to follow the same rules for graceful degradation as you would for progressive enhancement:

Write valid, standards-compliant HTML
Use external style sheets for your designs and layout
Use externally linked scripts for interactivity
Make sure the content is accessible even to low-level browsers without CSS or JavaScript

What is a Polyfill?
A polyfill, or polyfiller, is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively. Flattening the API landscape if you will.
